            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>R1 : The user can choose a station, and the application must show data related to that station.</li>
                <li>R2 : Based of the user's selection, the application will display options to find more information relevant to that station.</li>
                <li>R3 : The user can choose a destination station, and the application will show the trial information between stations.</li>
                <li>R4 : The application must provide visualizations (e.g., graphs, maps) to help users understand the data.</li>
                <li>R5 : The application should be user-friendly and accessible, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.</li>
