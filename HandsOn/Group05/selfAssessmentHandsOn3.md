## Comments on the Self-Assessment

We attempted to reconcile the bike station entities using their addresses. However, most reconciliations were unsuccessful due to the following reasons:

- Many stations did not have corresponding entities in Wikidata.  
- The number of potential matches was extremely high, requiring manual review of thousands of entries, which made the process impractical within the scope of this assignment.

As a result, we focused on cleaning and structuring the dataset to ensure it is ready for RDF generation, even without full reconciliation.
