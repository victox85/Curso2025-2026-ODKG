        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This dataset contains information regarding the schedules, stops, frequencies and other information of the Municipal Transport Company (EMT) of the city 
                of Madrid. 
            </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>R1. Data are in one of the smart city domains.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes. It is part of the city's effort to track the public transport to better inform the users,
                            either through third party applications or official outlets that would have easier access to such information.
                            
                        </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>R2. Data are available as a CSV file.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes. All files are CSVs even if the extension is ".txt".
                        </p>

                    <h3>R3. Data have an open license so they can be published.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes. Its license allows for distribution of this information either through the same license or a different one.
                        </p>

                    <h3>R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes. The "stops" file for example, contains coordinates to be able to display them in a map.
                        </p>

                    <h3>R5. Documentation exists for the data (optional).</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes. It can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference?csw=1&hl=es-419">here</a>.
                            It relates more to Google Transit than solely on the dataset itself but it can be very useful.
                        </p>

                    <h3>R6. Data can come from multiple data sources (optional).</h3>
                        <p>
                            Data in this dataset only comes from the EMT. But, we think it has a high potential for integration with other datasets.
                        </p>
