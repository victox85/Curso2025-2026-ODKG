    <h1>SafeSchool Madrid - Application Requirements</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>General Description</h2>
        <p>
            SafeSchool Madrid is a web application designed to map road accidents and speed cameras, and to assess safety risks 
            around schools (within 150–300 meters). The app highlights "priority zones" where interventions such as new speed cameras, 
            speed bumps, pedestrian crossings, or human supervision are necessary. Main outputs include interactive maps, school risk rankings, 
            informative profiles, and exportable reports.
