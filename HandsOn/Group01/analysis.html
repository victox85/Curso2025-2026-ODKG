    <h1>Anlyse Dataset

    <h2>Definition of the data</h2>
        
    <p>The main dataset we will be working with contains information about different educational institutions classfied by district and neighborhood in Madrid.</p>
    <p>The key atrributes included in the dataset that will be essential when creating the linked data and devoloping the different ontologies are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>NAME(string): The name of the eduactional institution, such as universities, faculties, halls of residence and university residences, many of which are available in wikidata.</li>
        <li>EQUIPMENT(categorical): The equipment, that includes if the institution is male, female, or mixed. This refers in particular to residences and halls of residence, and not to universities.</li>
        <li>TRANSPORT(string): This includes the nearby subway station of the entity, for example, some of them are: "Metro: Ciudad Universitaria", "Metro: Moncloa".</li>
        <li>ACCESIBILITY(categorical): This defines the accesibility to the educational institution, with three posible categories: (0, 1, 3).</li>
        <li>CITY(string): Indicates the name of the city to which the educational institution belongs.</li>
        <li>PROVINCE(string): Indicates the name of the province to which the educational institution belongs.</li>

        <li>POSTALCODE(numeric): Indicates the postal code of the educational institution.</li>
        <li>LONGITUDE(numeric): Is a continuous numeric variable that defines the position of the educational institution. It represents a decimal value in degrees and can take any value within its valid range</li>
        <li>LATITUDE(numeric): Is a continuous numeric variable that defines the position of the educational institution. It represents a decimal value in degrees and can take any value within its valid range</li>
        <li>TELEFONO(numeric): Is a numeric variable that includes the phone number of the educational institution.</li>
        <li>EMAIL(string): Is a string that defines the email of the educational institution.</li>
        <li>TYPE(categorical): Is a categoric variable that defines the type of the educational institution. The possible categories are: (university centers, halls of residence, other university centers, university schools, faculties, clinics veterinary centers).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are also working with three additional datasets that describe public libraries, parks and gardens, and sports centers in Madrid. Apart from the name of each entity, the remaining attributes are the same across all three categories, so we will define a single set of attributes that applies to all datasets:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>NAME(string): The name of the entitie (park, library or sport center), such as universities, faculties, halls of residence and university residences, many of which are available in wikidata.</li>
        <li>TRANSPORT(string): This includes the nearby subway station of the entity, for example, some of them are: "Metro: Igleisa", "Cercanias: Valdebernardo".</li>
        <li>TOWN(string): Indicates the name of the city to which the entitie (park, library or sport center) belongs.</li>
        <li>PROVINCE(string): Indicates the name of the province to which the entitie (park, library or sport center) belongs.</li>
        <li>NEIGHBORHOOD(string): Indicates the name of the neighborhood to which the entitie (park, library or sport center) belongs.</li>
        <li>DISTRICT(string): Indicates the name of the district to which the ntitie (park, library or sport center) belongs.</li>
        <li>POSTALCODE(numeric): Indicates the postal code of the entitie (park, library or sport center).</li>
        <li>LONGITUDE(numeric): Is a continuous numeric variable that defines the position of the entitie (park, library or sport center). It represents a decimal value in degrees and can take any value within its valid range</li>
        <li>LATITUDE(numeric): Is a continuous numeric variable that defines the position of the entitie (park, library or sport center). It represents a decimal value in degrees and can take any value within its valid range</li>
        <li>PHONE(numeric): Is a numeric variable that includes the phone number of the entitie (park, library or sport center).</li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Definition of the schema</h2>

    <p>For defining the schema, we will identify the potential classes, the instances, and the properties, domains, ranges and relationships that can be observed at first glance.</p>

    
    <ul>
        <li>Potential classes: educationalInstitution, library, park, sportcenter, town, province, neighborhood, district, subway station.</li>
        <li>Instances:some examples of instances for some of the classes proposed can be:</li>
            <li>educationalInstitution: "colegiomayorRoncalli", "UniversidadPolitecnicaMadrid"</li>
            <li>neighborhood: "Ciudad Universitaria", "Vallehermoso"</li>
        

        <li>Object Properties: his are those properties that link instances from different classes. Some examples are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>locatedIn</strong>
                    <ul>
                            <li>educationalInstitution → locatedIn → district</li>
                            <li>sportcenter → locatedIn → neighborhood</li>
                            <li>park → nearConnected → subwayStation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>adscribedTo</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>educationalInstitution(subclass:halls of residence) → adscribedTo → educationalInstitution(subclass:university center)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>



        <li>Datatype Properties: his are those properties that defines literal values of instances from different classes. Some examples are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>hasPhoneNumber</strong>
                    <ul>
                            <li>educationalInstitution --- hasponeNumber ---- "number"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>hasPostalCode</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>sportcenter --- hasPostalCode ---- "number"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Resource Naming Strategy </h1>

    <p>A Resource Naming Strategy defines how the URI's of resources (classes, properties and individuals) are created for our semantic Linked Data System</p>
    <p>This must ensure: persistence, so they cannot change over time, clarity, they must be easy to interpret, uniqueness, one Uri per source, and distinction between ontology and data.</p>
