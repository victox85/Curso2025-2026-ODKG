</ul>


<h2>Madrid Facilities and Entities</h2>

<h3>Requirement 1: Data are in one of the smart city domains</h3>
<p>The selected dataset is related to smart cities because it defines the different entities and facilities in Madrid that are available on the
     official website www.madrid.es. This means that all the necessary information, such as location, schedules, or public transport access to 
     each entity, is available online. Therefore, this dataset can be included in the domain of governance and public administration within the 
     smart cities framework, as it involves electronic administration and the management of open data.</p>

<h3>Requirement 2: Data are available as a CSV file</h3>
<p>The selected dataset is available as a CSV file, which is located inside the folder "CSV FILES" uploaded for the first assignment</p>

<h3>Requirement 3: Data have an open license so they can be published</h3>
<p>The open license of this data can be found in the following link: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal">https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal</a></p>

<h3>Requirement 4:  Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h3>
<p>In this dataset, which contains information about different entities in Madrid, some of the attributes that can be associated with generic 
    real-world entities are:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Certain entities, such as "Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas", "Banco de España", or "Canal de Isabel II"</li>
    <li>The locations of these entities, including municipality, province, neighborhood, and district</li>
    <li>n some cases, the nearby subway station of the entity, for example Metro: Retiro or Metro: Ibiza, in the transport attribute.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirement 5: Documentation exists for the data (optional)</h3>
<p>In this dataset, a brief description is provided, along with keywords, category, language, dataset identifier, last update, and creation 
    date. This documentation is available at: <a href="https://datos.gob.es/en/catalogo/l01280796-equipamientos-y-entidades-de-la-ciudad-de-madrid-que-hay… ">https://datos.gob.es/en/catalogo/l01280796-equipamientos-y-entidades-de-la-ciudad-de-madrid-que-hay… </a></p>    

<h3>Requirement 6: Data can come from multiple data sources (optional)</h3>
<p>In this case, the data come just for one simple data source</p>


<h2>Madrid Daily Noise Pollution</h2>
<h3>Requirement 1: Data are in one of the smart city domains</h3>
<p>These data belong to the Smart Environment domain of smart cities, as they result from the technological implementation of connected sensors 
    to monitor pollution, in this case, noise pollution. The public release of this information enables analysis that can lead to policies to 
    improve quality of life. Therefore, it is inderectly related to the Smart Living domain of smart cities.</p>
 
<h3>Requirement 2: Data are available as a CSV file</h3>
<p>The selected dataset is available as a CSV file, which is located inside the folder "CSV FILES" uploaded for the first assignment</p>
 
<h3>Requirement 3: Data have an open license so they can be published</h3>
<p>The open license of this data can be found in the following link: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal">https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-l…
 
<h3>Requirement 4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h3>
<p>The dataset contains information that can be associated with real-world entities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The NMT column:</strong> it is the identifier of the monitoring station. On the same portal  <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=b8c42…">https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=b8c42…</a> , there is another dataset that provides detailed information about each of these stations (name, location, district, neighborhood, geographic coordinates, and altitude). Therefore, the information from both datasets can be linked. This allows us to obtain complete spatial information that can in turn be linked to external entities (neighborhood, district, street) in Wikidata or DBpedia, or via their geographic coordinates.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal information:</strong> Year, Month, Day, Period. These attributes can be linked to temporal ontologies, which may enable connections with information such as atmospheric conditions which may be related to the data obtained. For instance, if a specific day is declared a public holiday on the Madrid City Council’s website, an increase in noise could be explained by this factor.</li>
<li><strong>Recorded acoustic magnitudes (LAeq, L1, L10, L50...):</strong> linkable to sensor ontologies, equivalent vocabularies and standards on noise regulation, or to information about recommended health-related thresholds for noise levels.</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Requirement 5: Documentation exists for the data (optional)</h3>
<p>The file is accompanied by a PDF document that provides a brief overall description of what is being measured, the time span covered (2014–present), and the measurement frequency. In addition, the document includes a table specifying the data type of each column and an explanation of what each represents. It is worth noting that there are two columns (station and period) whose names in the dataset do not match those in the document; however, it is easy to identify that they refer to the same information, so the dataset’s content becomes fully understandable after reading this additional documentation. Moreover, on the portal that hosts the data, an annual aggregated version is also available, and the information about the stations indicates if any of them are currently affected by a specific issue (e.g., station 3 currently affected by construction work).</p>


<h2>Madrid Daily Metereology</h2>
<h3>Requirement 1: Data are in one of the smart city domains</h3>
<p>The dataset belongs mainly to the Smart Environment domain of Smart Cities, with intersections in Smart Living/Health, 
    since it tracks temperature using geolocated stations over time.</p>
<h3>Requirement 2: Data are available as a CSV file</h3>
<p>The selected dataset is available as a CSV file, which is located inside the folder "CSV FILES" uploaded for the first assignment</p>
<h3>Requirement 3:  Data have an open license so they can be published</h3>
<p>The open license of this data can be found in the following link: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal">https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal</a>
</p>
<h3>Requirement 4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h3>
<p>The dataset can be easily linked with real-world entities such as geographic areas (province, municipality, station) and time 
    (days, months, years). Fields like “PROVINCIA”, “MUNICIPIO” and “ESTACION” directly map to real-world locations, referring to 
    administrative areas and physical meteorological stations. Similarly, “ANO”, “MES”, “D01”, “D02”, etc., represent actual calendar 
    dates, making the dataset directly relatable to external sources such as other meteorological records, climate models, traffic 
    patterns or public health data for the same period.
    In this dataset, which contains meteorological information for Madrid, several attributes can be directly associated with generic
     real-world entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurement stations, such as Plaza España, Escuelas Aguirre, or Cuatro Caminos, which correspond to physical monitoring sites across the city.</li>
<li>Geographical entities, including province, municipality, and neighborhood, which situate each measurement station in its real location.</li>
<li>Meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, or precipitation, which represent physical environmental conditions 
    that can be observed and compared with global standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirement 5: Documentation exists for the data (optional)</h3>
<p>The dataset is fully documented by the Dirección General de Sostenibilidad y Control Ambiental.
    It explains the meaning of each field (province, municipality, station, parameter, measurement technique, year, month, day), 
    the coding of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), and the mapping of station 
    codes to real locations. It also specifies the validation rules, indicating that only data marked with the code “V” are valid. 
    This ensures the dataset is standardized, interpretable, and suitable for integration into Smart City applications.
