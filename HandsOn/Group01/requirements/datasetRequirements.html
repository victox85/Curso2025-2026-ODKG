<h1>Datasets about: Student-oriented facilities by district</h1>

<h2>Requirement 1: Data are in one of the smart city domains</h2>
<p>The selected datasets: educational institutions (universities, faculties/schools, student residences, and halls of residence), parks and gardens, libraries, and sports centers, organized by district; are highly relevant within the smart cities framework, as they integrate information about urban facilities and their connectivity (including public transport). This enables students and citizens to make data-based decisions about where to study or live based on accessibility, proximity to libraries and sports facilities, and overall neighborhood quality. This fits perfectly within the <strong>Smart Living </strong> domain of smart cities.

At the administrative level, these datasets promote <strong>smart governance</strong> by leveraging open data to enhance transparency, evidence-based analysis, and spatial planning. For instance, assessing a district’s suitability for the student population or prioritizing mobility and service investments.</p>

<h2>Requirement 2: Data are available as a CSV file</h2>
<p>The selected datasets are all available as CSV files, which are located inside the uploaded folder "CSV FILES". Each document is also available in GEORSS, RDF, JSON and XML formats.<p>

<h2>Requirement 3: Data have an open license so they can be published</h2>
<p>The open license of all the data is the same and can be found in the following link: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal">https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal</a> </p>
<p>In particular, this license allows the <strong>reuse of documents and data for both commercial and non-commercial purposes</strong>. Authorized reuse includes actions such as copying, distributing, modifying, adapting, extracting, reorganizing, and combining the data.  

Reuse is permitted as long as certain conditions are met, such as not distorting the meaning of the information, acknowledging the source (“Data source: Madrid City Council”), indicating the date of the last update if available, and not attempting to re-identify individuals from anonymized data. For the complete list of conditions and further details, please refer to the link above. </p>

<h2>Requirement 4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The selected open datasets can be interlinked mainly through <strong>location entities</strong> 
    (such as neighborhood and district), as well as through <strong>public transport stations</strong> 
    located near each facility, since this information is available across all our datasets.
  </li>

  <li>
    There are <strong>real-world relationships</strong> between some of the facilities, 
    such as student residences or libraries that are associated with or belong to a university. 
    For example, in Wikidata the <em>Colegio Mayor Alcalá</em> is linked to the 
    <em>Complutense University of Madrid</em>, which is also listed as the owner of the 
    <em>Complutense University Library</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Each instance in our datasets represents a <strong>real physical or administrative entity</strong>, 
    and many of them have corresponding records in global semantic repositories such as 
    <strong>Wikidata</strong>, <strong>GeoNames</strong>, or <strong>DBpedia</strong>. 
    This enables the integration of existing information from these global registries, 
    enriching our datasets and enhancing their <strong>semantic linkability</strong>.
  </li>
</ul> 


<h2>Requirement 5: Documentation exists for the data (optional)</h2>
<p>
All datasets come from the municipal website 
<a href="https://www.madrid.es" target="_blank">www.madrid.es</a>. 
Therefore, they all share the same metadata document describing their structure, 
which was last updated in May 2019. </p>

<p>
This document provides a detailed <strong>description of each attribute</strong>, including examples, 
the meaning of categorical values (such as accessibility), 
and, in some cases, the data format (e.g., coordinates). 
It also specifies the <strong>update frequency</strong> of the information. The datasets reflect the <strong>latest information available</strong> 
on the municipal website, which is updated as soon as changes are reported or detected.
</p>

<h2>Requirement 6: Data can come from multiple data sources</h2>
<p>
The datasets used in this project come from open data sources including the
<a href="https://datos.madrid.es" target="_blank">Open Data Portal of the Madrid City Council</a> 
and the 
<a href="https://datos.gob.es" target="_blank">Spanish Government Open Data Portal</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although they are hosted on different platforms, 
all datasets ultimately originate from the official website of the Madrid City Council
<a href="https://www.madrid.es" target="_blank">https://www.madrid.es</a>, 
ensuring consistency and reliability across sources.
