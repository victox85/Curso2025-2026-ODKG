<h1>Non-Municipal Facilities in Madrid</h1>

<h2>Description of the Application</h2>
<p>
  The application’s primary goal is to help people <strong>discover, locate, and compare non-municipal facilities</strong>
  (universities, parks and gardens, sports centers and libraries) across Madrid.
  Users can quickly find what they need by <strong>area</strong> (district/neighbourhood/municipality), by <strong>category</strong>
  (type of facility), or by <strong>proximity</strong> to a chosen point. For each facility, the app highlights practical
  details—address, opening hours, contact info—and, when available, <strong>nearby public transport</strong> (metro, bus, train)
  to make planning a visit fast and convenient.
</p>
<p>
  Typical tasks include: “show all universities in Chamartín,” “find libraries in Prosperidad,” or
  “list sports centers near me that are easy to reach by Metro.” The emphasis is on <strong>clear, actionable results</strong> rather than raw data.
</p>

<h2>Possible use cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Residents searching for specific facility types within their district or neighbourhood and checking how to get there.</li>
  <li>Visitors identifying facilities of interest near a location and reviewing nearby metro/bus/train lines.</li>
  <li>Analysts exploring coverage and diversity of facility types per administrative area to support planning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Search and Filter by Area:</strong>
    <p>
      Users can select a <em>district</em>, <em>neighbourhood</em>, or <em>municipality</em> (where applicable) to retrieve all facilities within that boundary.
      Results must update instantly when the user switches area, and the interface should clearly display the current area context (e.g., breadcrumb or header tags).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Filter by Facility Type (Category):</strong>
    <p>
      Users can refine results using a <em>type</em> facet (e.g., university, library, sport center, park).
      Multiple selections are allowed, and each selection updates the result list and counts. The system should remember selected filters when users navigate between pages or the map.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Keyword Search:</strong>
    <p>
      A free-text search matches <em>names</em> and <em>descriptions</em> (e.g., “Universidad Politécnica”, “Parque del Oeste”).
      It should tolerate minor typos and support simple operators (quoted phrases, AND/OR) to narrow or broaden queries.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Map-Based Exploration:</strong>
    <p>
      An interactive map allows panning/zooming to explore facilities visually. The visible viewport determines which results appear in the side list.
      Clicking a marker opens a concise preview (name, type, address, transport hints) with a link to the full detail.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Facility Detail View:</strong>
    <p>
      Each facility page (or drawer) shows: name, type(s), description, opening hours (if provided), address with “open in maps”, 
      contact details (phone, email, website), district/neighbourhood labels, coordinates, accessibility note (if any), and transport hints (e.g., “Metro L7; Bus 27, 53”).
      Provide consistent formatting and clearly mark missing fields.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Public Transport Context:</strong>
    <p>
      When the dataset includes transport information, display it prominently in the detail view. If additional transport datasets are integrated later,
      show nearby <em>stops/lines</em> within a configurable radius and let users filter results by transport mode (metro/bus/train).
      Where possible, provide quick links to official timetables or network maps.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Proximity and “Near Me” Queries:</strong>
    <p>
      Users can search “near a point” (by typing an address or clicking the map) with a distance slider (e.g., 200–2000 m).
      Results should be sortable by distance and show an approximate walking time badge when coordinates are available.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Administrative Facets and Summaries:</strong>
    <p>
      Present <em>facets</em> and <em>counts</em> by district and neighbourhood (e.g., “Universities (12) in Chamartín”), enabling quick drill-down.
      Area summary pages should list top facility types and provide a compact overview (e.g., “Most common categories in this area”).
    </p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The application should load quickly and handle large datasets efficiently, especially when users perform searches or interact with the map.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Ensure that data privacy and security measures are implemented when accessing or storing data. Users should not be able to access sensitive or unauthorized information.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The application should be fully accessible, following best practices for web accessibility (WCAG standards). This includes support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and mobile responsiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application User Interface</h2>
<p>
  The interface should be <strong>clean, approachable, and responsive</strong>, promoting clarity and speed. The following components will be included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prominent Search Bar:</strong> A forgiving, fast search across names and descriptions with suggestions for common facility types and areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Filters Panel:</strong> Clear, multi-select filters for area (district → neighbourhood), facility type, and—when available—transport mode; chips/badges reflect active filters.</li>
  <li><strong>Two-Pane Layout (Map + Results):</strong> An elegant split view with a dynamic map on the left and a sortable, paginated results list on the right; hover/click keeps both in sync.</li>
  <li><strong>Concise Detail Drawer/Page:</strong> A well-structured detail view with readable sections (Overview, Address & Contact, Transport, Hours) and an easy “open in maps” action.</li>
  <li><strong>Helpful Empty States:</strong> Friendly guidance when no results match, suggesting filter tweaks or nearby areas.</li>
</ul>
