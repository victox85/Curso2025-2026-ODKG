## Comments on the self-assessment
I’d like to clarify that everyone in the group has contributed to this phase. However, since we’re still waiting to figure out how to fork a project that already comes from another fork, on GitHub it will only show the leader as making changes. Still, I want to stress that we all took part in this work.
