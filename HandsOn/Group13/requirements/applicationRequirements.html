      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This application will provide an interactive dashboard for Caryâ€™s smart
        mobility data. It lets users explore bicycle/pedestrian traffic counts
        and EV charging usage across the town. Users can select specific sensor
        locations or charging stations and view detailed usage statistics and
        trends.

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          R1: The user can select an Eco-Counter sensor (or EV charging station)
          from a map or list; the app displays data related to that selection
          (counts or charging sessions).
        </li>
        <li>
          R2: Based on the selected sensor or station, the application shows
          relevant information (e.g. daily or weekly usage graphs, average
          counts, session duration). Details could include sensor name,
          location, and latest readings.
        </li>
        <li>
          R3: The user can compare two selections. For example, after choosing
          one sensor, the user can choose another to view side-by-side data
          (e.g. comparing two locations or two different EV stations).
        </li>
        <li>
          R4: The application must provide visualizations (e.g. time-series
          graphs and maps) to help users understand patterns in the data. For
          example, display charts of counts over time and mark sensor locations
          on a map.
        </li>
        <li>
          R5: The interface should be user-friendly and responsive. It should
          include clear menus or search to find sensors/stations by name or
          address, and present data in an accessible manner.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mockups</h3>
      <p>Two images:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          `map_view.png`: represents the interactive map where you can select
          the different EV stations in Cary.
        </li>
        <li>
          `comparison_ev-stations.png`: represents the comparison between two EV
          stations data. For a single EV station visualization, only data for
          this station will be appearing.
        </li>
