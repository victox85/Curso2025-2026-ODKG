    <h2>Analysis of Selected Datasets</h2>

    <h3>R1: Smart cities domain</h3>
    <p>
      All selected datasets come from Cary Open Data. They describe smart-city
      transportation and mobility: pedestrian/bicycle/cars counters and EV
      charging stations. These clearly belong to the smart cities domain.
    </p>

    <h3>R2: CSV format</h3>
    <p>
      Each dataset is available as CSV and has been downloaded in that format.
    </p>

    <h3>R3: Open license</h3>
    <p>
      All datasets are published under the CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)
      license. This allows redistribution and publication.
    </p>

    <h3>R4: Linkable entities</h3>
    <p>
      The datasets contain real-world locations (sensor sites, charging stations
      with latitude/longitude) and the town of Cary, NC. These can be linked to
      external datasets such as DBpedia or GeoNames.
    </p>

    <h3>R5: Documentation (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      The Cary Open Data portal provides descriptions and metadata for each
      dataset, including schema and notes about collection methods.
    </p>

    <h3>R6: Multiple sources (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      Two datasets are used: Eco-Counter traffic data and EV charging data. They
      cover different aspects of smart mobility in the Cary town.
